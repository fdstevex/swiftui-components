# swiftui-components
This is a collection of very simple SwiftUI components that I've built
for various projects.  They solve some problem I had at the time, and 
this project is my way of both saving them for my own future use, and
sharing them with other people who may be trying to sovle the same 
problem.

I intend to add more documentation, screenshots and so on when I 
have the opportunity to do so.

Run the Xcode project, and you'll get a list of components.  Tap one to
see it in action.

This isn't set up as a ready-to-use library since there's no common theme
behind them, and they're all individually too small to merit their own
library.  Most of the compontns are a single file, so feel free to copy & paste 
them into your own project.
